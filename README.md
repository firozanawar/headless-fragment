Implementation and demonstration of Headless Fragment in android

A headless Fragment is simply a Fragment that does not have a layout or View to render. It behaves like effectively helper classes, except they are context and life-cycle aware.

⇒ Handling Configuration Changes with Fragments using setRetainInstance(true) so they are not destroyed and recreated on orientation changes.

⇒ Use headless Fragment for Android M run-time permissions and to check network connectivity etc.

⇒ Great place to perform asynchronous tasks as they are not destroyed on Activity orientation changes.
